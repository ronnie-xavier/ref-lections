What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros
logical grouping instead of random grouping
associated commit message provides more context
cons
may forget to commit sometimes losing work


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
usage different
git is targeted towards coding
where multiple files need to be changed together
others are more used towards document or presentation prep

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives all the changes and comments in chronological order
git diff gives all changes that made between two versions so can be used to see which 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you always have a possibility of going back and analysing the changes made
you can try making bigger and more complex changes in logical steps and know that you can go back if you find something wrong and analyse

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
