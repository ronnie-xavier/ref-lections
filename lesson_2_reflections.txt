What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This will enable maintaining a history of changes to files
enabling going back and forth between changes
A .git folder is created which keeps the metadata associated with any changes to files in the repository being tracked
it wont start tracking till the files are manually added for tracking

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where all changes to your file are made - this is moved to the staging area when you are working on a subset of your files while making a logical change. And repository is used when the logical change has been completed successfully
