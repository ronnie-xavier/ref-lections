When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For storage purposes
    Also to ensure my code is not lost if my system gets damaged
    When multiple people are working on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Same as why we want commits at logical intervals - it does not interrupt our work and only once we finish the logical code changes do we merge with what evertone else has done
    For example, i would do my commit now - explaining manual pulls

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to clone a github repository to your github account
    clone is used to clone a github repository to your local workstation 
    Remote is to copy a branch to github - using git remote add
    Branch is a different flow on the same repository (either local or remote) and is used to keep changes logically separate
