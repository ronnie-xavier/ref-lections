What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This will enable maintaining a history of changes to files
enabling going back and forth between changes
A .git folder is created which keeps the metadata associated with any changes to files in the repository being tracked
it wont start tracking till the files are manually added for tracking

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where all changes to your file are made - this is moved to the staging area when you are working on a subset of your files while making a logical change. And repository is used when the logical change has been completed successfully

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You keep adding files that you need for that logical change
Continue making changes and in between move to staging area
Once that logical change is done and working on your system, final changes are saved to staging area
Then do a git diff â€”staged to see if someone else has changed any other files, and once you make sure all changes are understood, you do a git commit


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
branches give easily identifiable names to different work streams
These can be merged in later with other branches once this branch works
for us, we create branches for each release - keeping code logically separate
